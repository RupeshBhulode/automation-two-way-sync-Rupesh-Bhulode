AI Usage Notes
Tools Used
ChatGPT (GPT-4) - For code structure planning, API documentation clarification, and debugging
Where AI Helped
API Documentation Summary: Used ChatGPT to quickly understand Trello and Google Sheets API endpoints instead of reading lengthy docs
Regex Pattern: Generated the email extraction regex in task_client.py
Error Handling Patterns: Got suggestions for try-catch structure in sync_logic.py
Code Comments: Generated initial comments which I then refined
What I Changed/Rejected
Example: ChatGPT initially suggested using a database (SQLite) for the state management instead of data.json. I rejected this because:

Added unnecessary complexity for a small project
JSON is human-readable and easier to debug
No concurrent access concerns with single-threaded polling
Keeps dependencies minimal
I also modified AI-generated logging statements to be more specific and actionable.
